  ## Introduction
This ReadMe, and the associated Jupyter Notebook, were written for assignment in the Machine Learning module, as part of a Higher Diploma in Science (Data Analytics). The specific questions to be answered are listed in the Questions Asked section below. The overall answers are to be found in the Jupyter notebook (Machine Learning Tasks.ipynb), along with the associated scripts.

## Technologies and Libraries
### Main Platform
* Python 3.7.9

### External libraries
These are libraries that are not normally part of the standard installation with Python, and will need to be installed prior to running some of these scripts. The questions that the libraries are needed for is listed after the library name.

* [DateTime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
* [Matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [PrettyTable](https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [SciKitLearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

#### Note:
You will also need to have installed the [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) library, as it provides some of the layouts for the Pandas dataframes.

## Setup
In order to run the scripts in this repository, it is necessary to have a complier capable of compiling Python 3.7.9. In addition, it will be necessary to install the external libraries (if you have not done so already), if you want to run the scripts on your own machine.
All the codes used in the Jupyter Notebook have been tested using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), and running through [Cmder](https://cmder.net/).

## Research
Research for the assignment was conducted through extensive internet research. A bibliography for each task is included in Jupyter Notebook, at the end of each section.

## Questions Asked
The assignment was broken into 4 parts. The specific tasks are listed in the notebook, and are summarised as follows:
1. Print the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places without the importation of any libraries.
2. Discuss the Chi-squared test for independence, and reproduce the results of the given test.
3. Discuss standard deviation, the difference between populationa and standard deviation with relation to accuracy of the estimate, and provide an example.
4. Explain k-means clustering with regards to the Fisher's Iris dataset, and discuss the implications.

## Status
The status of this project is complete. As there is a submission date of the 18th December, 2020, the files will not be altered, from their current format, after that date. Where the last push/alter date is prior to the 18th December, 2020,, that date can be viewed as the completion date.
