    "\n",
    "The method divides the number whose square root is to be found (*Number* in this case 2) by a starting number (*zStart*, initial value of 1). The resultant is then added back to zStart, and then the whole number is divided by 2. This process continues until the difference between the zStart number, and the previous zStart number (*xRoot*) is less than 1 divided by 100 to the power of 100 (i.e. there is less than digit difference at 200 decimal places)."

    "\n",
    "The calculated Newton-Raphson method diverges from the \"official\" NASA version after 17 decimal places, where the method returns 0949 instead od 0950. This is due to issues within Python, where floats do not generally display more than 17 decimal places, even if they hold more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, event when the variables hold more than 17 decimal places, they cannot hold more than 50 decimal places. This results in all the digits after the 50th decimal place being printed as 0. This can be seen in the above print out, when the float was specified at 100 decimal places. This issue can be resolved by using imported libraries, which can force more decimal places to be held. However that was not allowed by the rules of the assignment."

    "1 P-value: The P-value calculated for the contingency table is 0.000410 (or 0.041%). This value is significantly below the probability vales of 0.05 (5%) and 0.01 (1%), it would suggest that the likelihood of getting such results is extremely unlikely if the null hypothesis is correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "2 Degrees of Freedom: The calculated degrees of freedom is 6, which is the same as the degrees of freedom on the source page.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Critical stat value: The critical stat  values is calculated as 24.571, and is given as 24.6 on the Wikipedia page. These results are the same, if rounding to only 1 significant decimal place is allowed. However, as noted above the critical stat values for 6 degrees of freedom, and the p-values of 0.05 and 0.01 are 12.592, abd 16.812 respectively. Given that the calculated value is significantly higher than the expected values, it would suggest that the null hypothesis is not valid.\n",

    "### Overall\n",
    "\n",
    "As per the assignment, the calculated critical stats value was found to be the same as the given value (24.571 / 24.6, as per point 3 above). In addition the p-value that was requested is 0.000410 (as per point 1 above).\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall result of the Chi-Squared testing suggests that the null hypothesis (*\"that each person's neighborhood of residence is independent of the person's occupational classification\"*) should be rejected, due to a p-value significantly lower than the probablity limits, and a critical stat value considerably higher than the Chi-Squared distribution tables would allow. As such, the alternative hypothesis *that each person's neighbourhood of residence is dependent on the person's occupational classification* must hold true."
