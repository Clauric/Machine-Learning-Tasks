    "The calculated Newton-Raphson method diverges from the \"official\" NASA version after 17 decimal places, where the method returns 0949 instead od 0950. This is due to issues within Python, where floats do not generally display more than 17 decimal places, even if they hold more.\n",

This results in all the digits after the 50th decimal place being printed as 0. This can be seen in the above print out, when the float was specified at 100 decimal places. This issue can be resolved by using imported libraries, which can force more decimal places to be held. However that was not allowed by the rules of the assignment."

    "This method is an old Japanese method described by <a href =\"http://www.afjarvis.staff.shef.ac.uk/maths/jarvisspec02.pdf\"> Frazer Jarvis</a>. The method involves an involves the use of 2 variables, \"A\" and \"B\". The initial value of the variable \"A\" is 5n (where n is the number for which the square root is being sought). In this case \"A\" would be equal to 10 (5n --> 5 x 2 = 10). The variable \"B\" can be any number, but the most accurate (through trial and error) is 5. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    + If A is greater than or equal to B, change the value of A to A - B, and add 10 to B.\n",
    "    + If B is greater than A, multiply A by 100, and place a 0 in the B variable, between the penultimate and final digit.\n",

    "    etc.....\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this subtraction (and multiplication) method, the value of B becomes the square root of the value of n. However, it is still required to place the decimal place in the correct spot."

    "#### Notes on approach 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The subraction method has an advantage over the Newton-Raphson method in that the value of B will always be greater than 0. This removes the issue, for Python, of the number of decimal places that can be calculated accurately, or displayed. In addition, by converting the number into a string, and placing a decimal place in the correct location, the method gives the impression of having been calculated by using floating point numbers, but has not been.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few issues with this method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The method requires the addition of a decimal place in the second position of the string. This is to convert it from 1.4E100 to 1.4..., as is the correct answer. For any number, whose square root is being sought, less than 100, there is no need to amend the code. For numbers greater than 100 there would need to be a change made in order to determine where the decimal place should go.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The method takes longer, in terms of iterations and time, to get to 100 decimal places than the Newton-Raphson method. A quick comparison between the two shows that it takes the Newton-Raphson method about 0.000000 seconds to run, and only requires 6 iterations of the code. The subratction method takes about 0.001 seconds to run, but requires 583 iterations of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The function used is a recursive function. After a certain number of recursions, there is a is a risk of stack overflow due to the depth of the recursive function (tail-call). While this can be reduced or eliminated by setting the recursive depth of the stack to be higher than the defaul in Python."

    "The issue of the (in)accuracy of floating point numbers, once they go passed the 16th/17th decimal place, can very clearly be seen by the value calculated in the Newton-Raphson method. Without the use of libraries to force the accuracy to the required level, other methods must be found. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the calculation of the value of the square root of 2 using an ever increasing interger, which was then converted to a string resolved the issue. However, this proved to be more time consuming than the Newton-Raphson method, however it was more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative method, that waas not fuly explored in Python (it was in Excel) was to set the initial value of the number to 2E200. This should have resulted in the same outcome as the subrtaction method, with the need to convert to a string and introduce a decimal point. This would have taken 308 iterations (in Excel) to complete."

As such, the alternative hypothesis *that each person's neighbourhood of residence is dependent on the person's occupational classification* must hold true."
