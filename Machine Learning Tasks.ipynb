    "\n",
    "Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library1 or otherwise. You should research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.\n",

    "### Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two issues to be resolved as part of this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) How to display a floating point number accurately to 100 decimal places.\n",
    "    2) How to calculate the square root of a number to 100 decimal places.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Display floating point number accurately to 100 decimal places\n",
    "\n",
    "On computers, floating point numbers (numbers with a decimal place) are represented as fractions based on the base 2 (binary). In addition, the current standard for representing floating point numbers is a 64 bit system. Using the IEEE 754 standard (<a href = \"http://www.cs.ucc.ie/~osullb/cs1101/notes/notes31.pdf\">O'Sullivan</a>), the most common representation of the floating point number is where:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1st digit represents the sign of the number (positive or negative).\n",
    "    2nd – 12th digit represents the number before the decimal point (the exponent).\n",
    "    13th – 54th digits represent the numbers after the decimal point (the fraction).\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of these two issues represent a problem for trying to calculate any number to a degree of accuracy if they cannot be expressed as a binary number. This results in approximation of the value, a high degree, but not perfect accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, 0.5$_{10}$ (0.1$_{2}$) can easily be represented as a binary number, using the above standard as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<u><i>0011 1111 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000</i></u> (O'Sullivan)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the number 0.1$_{10}$ cannot be represented to the same degree of accuracy. Converting 0.1$_{10}$ into base 2 results in:\n",
    "\n",
    "<u><i>0.0001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011</i></u> (<a href = \"https://www.exploringbinary.com/why-0-point-1-does-not-exist-in-floating-point\">Regan, 2012</a>)\n",
    "\n",
    "When reconverted back into base 10, this results in a value of:\n",
    "\n",
    "<u><i>0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625</i></u> (Regan, 2012)\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href = \"https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/IEEE754.PDF\">Kahan (1997)</a> notes that in a floating point number, the number of significant decimal places that can be achieved in 15 – 17 (p. 4). In the above base 10 representation, if the number were rounded to 17 decimal places, it becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<u><i>0.10000000000000001</i></u> (Regan, 2012)\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that even though we can calculate a number to up to 50 decimal places, rounding a number to even 17 decimal places will produce a rounding error, and will not return the same number with which we started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing specifically with the square root of two, it is known that it is an irrational number (i.e. the pattern of the numbers does not repeat, unlike the pattern of 0011 in the value of 0.1($_{2}$) (<a href = \"https://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/math/q1.htm\">Alfeld, 1996</a>). Like above, even though the decimal output for the square root of 2 can be shown to approx. 53 decimal places, the rounding issue identified will mean that after about 17 significant digits, the number produced by any method involving floating point numbers will result in inaccuracies. This can be seen in the Newton-Raphson method below.\n"

    "\n",
    "The calculated Newton-Raphson method diverges from the \"official\" NASA version after 17 decimal places, where the method returns 0949 instead of 0950. This is due to issues within Python, where floats do not generally display more than 17 decimal places, even if they hold more.\n",

    "Additionally, event when the variables hold more than 17 decimal places, they cannot hold more than 50 decimal places. This results in all the digits after the 50th decimal place being printed as 0. This can be seen in the above print out, when the float was specified at 100 decimal places. This issue can be resolved by using imported libraries, which can force more decimal places to be held. However that was not allowed by the rules of the assignment.\n",

    "### Option 2: Subtraction method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is an old Japanese method described by <a href =\"http://www.afjarvis.staff.shef.ac.uk/maths/jarvisspec02.pdf\"> Frazer Jarvis</a>. The method involves an involves the use of 2 variables, \"A\" and \"B\". The initial value of the variable \"A\" is 5n (where n is the number for which the square root is being sought). In this case \"A\" would be equal to 10 (5n --> 5 x 2 = 10). The variable \"B\" can be any number, but the most accurate (through trial and error) is 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "The logic behind the method is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    + If A is greater than or equal to B, change the value of A to A - B, and add 10 to B.\n",
    "    + If B is greater than A, multiply A by 100, and place a 0 in the B variable, between the penultimate and final digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 3 iterations of this method, for the square root of 2, would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) A = 10, B = 5  --> A > B  --> A = A - B = 10 - 5 = 5,  B = B + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15\n",
    "    2) A = 5, B = 15  --> A < B  --> A = A x 100 = 5 x 100 = 500,  B = B[0] & \"0\" & B[1] = 1 & 0 & 5 = 105\n",
    "    3) A = 500, B = 105  --> A > B  --> A = A - B = 500 - 105 = 395,  B = B + 10 = 105 + 10 = 115\n",
    "    etc.....\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Notes on approach 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The subraction method has an advantage over the Newton-Raphson method in that the value of B will always be greater than 0. This removes the issue, for Python, of the number of decimal places that can be calculated accurately, or displayed. In addition, by converting the number into a string, and placing a decimal place in the correct location, the method gives the impression of having been calculated by using floating point numbers, but has not been.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few issues with this method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The method requires the addition of a decimal place in the second position of the string. This is to convert it from 1.4E100 to 1.4..., as is the correct answer. For any number, whose square root is being sought, less than 100, there is no need to amend the code. For numbers greater than 100 there would need to be a change made in order to determine where the decimal place should go.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The method takes longer, in terms of iterations and time, to get to 100 decimal places than the Newton-Raphson method. A quick comparison between the two shows that it takes the Newton-Raphson method about 0.000000 seconds to run, and only requires 6 iterations of the code. The subratction method takes about 0.001 seconds to run, but requires 583 iterations of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The function used is a recursive function. After a certain number of recursions, there is a is a risk of stack overflow due to the depth of the recursive function (tail-call). While this can be reduced or eliminated by setting the recursive depth of the stack to be higher than the default in Python, it is not ideal, and would use up considerably more processing power and storage space than the Netwon-Raphson method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check on the accuracy of the two methods\n",
    "\n",
    "##### NASA\n",
    "It is important to check on the accuracy of the two methods. The quickest methof is to check the value against the known value of the square root of 2. For this we can use the value of the square root of 2, as provided by <a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/sqrt2.1mil\">NASA</a>. As can be seen below for 100 decimal places the Newton-Raphson method, with only 17 decimals displaying accurately, is off by 2.22E-16 (1.5E-13%). The subtraction method matches perfectly to 100 decimal places."

    "\n",
    "The issue of the (in)accuracy of floating point numbers, once they go passed the 16th/17th decimal place, can very clearly be seen by the value calculated in the Newton-Raphson method. Without the use of libraries to force the accuracy to the required level, other methods must be found. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the calculation of the value of the square root of 2 using an ever increasing interger, which was then converted to a string resolved the issue. However, this proved to be more time consuming than the Newton-Raphson method, however it was more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative method, that waas not fuly explored in Python (it was in Excel) was to set the initial value of the number to 2E200. This should have resulted in the same outcome as the subtraction method, with the need to convert to a string and introduce a decimal point. This would have taken 308 iterations (in Excel) to complete.\n",

The <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test”> Wikipedia</a> article gives the table below as an example, stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6.

    "### What is Chi-Squared testing for independence?\n",
    "Chi-Squared independence testing is used to determine if <i>“two categorical variables are related in some population”</i> <a href = https://www.spss-tutorials.com/chi-square-independence-test/> (Berg, 2020)</a>. It is an omnibus test, which means that it tests the data as a whole, and does not identify where the exact relationships lie <a href = https://pythonfordatascienceorg.wordpress.com/chi-square-python/> (Python for Data Science, 2020)</a>. This relationship identification would require additional testing after the Chi-Squared resting is complete. Another way of explaining Chi-Squared testing is that it is used to determine whether there is a difference between the expected distribution of a variable and the actual distribution of a variable <a href = https://towardsdatascience.com/running-chi-square-tests-in-python-with-die-roll-data-b9903817c51b> (Huneycutt, 2018)</a>. It is often used to determine if the sample data gathered matches, or it a good fit for the population as a whole <a href = https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/chi-square/> (Statistics How To, 2020)</a>. In order to use a Chi-squared test, the data should be random, mutally exclusive, and not have been processed <a href = https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chi-square-statistic.asp> (Hayes, 2020)</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chi-Squared testing two hypothesis are made:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b><u>Null Hypothesis (H$_{0}$)</b></u> that there is no relationship between the two categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b><u>Alternative Hypothesis (H$_{1}$)</b></u> that there is a relationship between the two categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-square testing gives three values to help determine whether the null hypothesis is correct. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b><u>Critical Value<b></u></b> is the area under a normally distributed graph, in which the test statistics are unlikely to be found for a given level of significancce <a href = https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section1/prc131.htm> (NIST/SEMATECH, 2020)</a>.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* <b><u>p-value<b></u></b> tells the tester the probability that the variables being tested are independent.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* <b><u>Degrees of freedom</b></u> is the maximum number of values that are allowed to vary within the test sample <a href = https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/degrees-of-freedom.asp> (Ganti, 2020)</a>. It is calculated as the number of classes there are in the sample less 1. Where there are multiple rows and columns it is the multiplication of the number of rows (less 1) times the number of columns (less 1) (e.g. for a table with 10 rows, and 8 columns, it would be (10 – 1) x (8 – 1) = 9 x 7 = 63).\n",
    "    \n",
    "Using these values, and a predetermined level of significance (alpha, normally 0.05, or 0.01), it is possible to determine whether the Null hypothesis should be accepted or rejected <a href = https://math.hws.edu/javamath/ryan/ChiSquare.html> (Mathbeans Project, 2020)</a>. Specifically, there are two tests that can be used <a href = “https://machinelearningmastery.com/chi-squared-test-for-machine-learning/” (Brownlee, 2018)</a>:\n",
